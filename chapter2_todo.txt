#
add more cluster methods, eg. kmeans manhattan, euclidean, etc

add tfidf scores for features
add cluster eval mechanism

make blobs lets us create random datasets
inertia per cluster??

use product instead of combinations


l = [['Something', 'Something else', 'Another thing'],
     ['Other things', 'More data', 'Element'],
     ['Stuff', 'data', 'etc']]
sub1 = [
    [s.ljust(max(len(i) for i in column)) for s in column]
    for column in zip(*l)]
for p in [" ".join(row) for row in zip(*sub1)]: print p
Here, first the list gets transformed with zip(*l): each of the sub lists gets passed as an own argument to zip(). The result is a list which combines the n-th entries of each old list, so you get [['Something', 'Other things', 'Stuff'], ['Something else', 'More data', 'data'], ...].

Then the entries whose lengths are to be matched are in the same column. In each of these columns the strings are ljust()ed to the greatest length in the group.

After that, the new list with the adjusted lengths is transformed again - in the same way as above - and the components joined with a " " in-between.

The resulting 1D list is then printed entry by entry.
