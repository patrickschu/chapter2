We usually examine the means for each cluster on each dimension using ANOVA to assess how distinct our clusters are. Ideally, we would obtain significantly different means for most, if not all dimensions, used in the analysis. The magnitude of the F values performed on each dimension is an indication of how well the respective dimension discriminates between clusters.

figure out real vs index centroids
what to use, how to keep them apart


evaluate correctness of cluster similairy matrix

add tfidf scores for features

entropy van be calcilated for every custering
inertia per cluster??

make blobs lets us create random datasets


use product instead of combinations
