#the script counts the occurence of specific words within certain clusters from word2vec.
#these clusters are contained in /Users/ps22344/Downloads/chapter2/current/clusterskmeans_54_19_10_07_30.json
#we need to look at clusters [50, 6, 22, 39, 24, 48, 1]
#for each cluster, we need a dict that counts occureence of a word in the files in /Users/ps22344/Downloads/craig_0208
#if needed, these should be broken down by category
